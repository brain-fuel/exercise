Today, I decided to have a think about working out. The thinking was pretty fruitless because I actually don't have enough context working out with kettlebells to understand how kettlebell performance correlates with other aspects of life. This results in me not having an idea as to what constitutes being 'strong enough'. Neither do I have an idea of what constitutes being 'flexible enough' as it relates to the upper body and lower body stretching that I'm doing.

I'm tentatively going for a set of priorities as follows

. Having the consistency to work out at least four days per week. Don't get injured; don't get sick; etc..
. Increasing the weight I use by 5 lb per month for all the lifts I currently do.
. Increase hip flexibility with the goal of
.. performing front splits
.. performing side splits

I don't know when I'm going to stop progressing along these lines; I don't know when this will cease to be feasible, but I'll reassess and act accordingly at that point.

The Coc Trainer (CoC T) just came in the mail today, so I'll be decreasing my reps to 10 and increasing my squeeze to use that one for my next workout.
